	abstract = {TempleOS is a unique operating system created by Terry A. Davis, designed to be a modern-day homage to the biblical Temple of Solomon. This thesis delves into the technical architecture, development environment, and underlying philosophy of TempleOS. It explores the operating system's innovative features, including its 64-bit programming environment, single-user design, and distinctive graphical interface. By examining the unconventional choices and constraints set by Davis, such as the 640x480 resolution and 16-bit color display, the thesis highlights how these decisions reflect his vision and the system's intended purpose. Furthermore, the analysis considers the cultural and historical context of TempleOS, its reception in the tech community, and its significance as an artifact of individual creativity in software development. Through this analysis, the thesis aims to provide a deeper understanding of TempleOS, both as a technical achievement and a manifestation of personal expression.},

	abstract = {Terrence Andrew Davis (December 15, 1969 – August 11, 2018) was an American electrical engineer and computer programmer best known for creating and designing TempleOS, an operating system in the public domain, by himself.
As a teenager, Davis learned assembly language on a Commodore 64. He later earned both a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University. He worked for several years at Ticketmaster as a programmer for VAX machines. In 1996, he began experiencing regular manic episodes, one of which led him to hospitalization. Initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was later declared to have schizophrenia. He subsequently collected disability payments and resided in Las Vegas with his parents until 2017.
Growing up Catholic, Davis was an atheist for some of his adult life. After experiencing a self-described "revelation", he proclaimed that he had been in direct communication with God and that God had commanded him to build a successor to the Second Temple. He then committed a decade to creating an operating system modeled after the DOS-based interfaces of his youth. In 2013, Davis announced that he had completed the project, now called "TempleOS". The operating system was generally regarded as a hobby system, not suitable for general use, but Davis received sympathy and support from the general public for bringing the project to fruition.
Davis amassed an online following and regularly posted video blogs to social media. Although he remained lucid when discussing computer-related subjects, his communication skills were significantly affected by his schizophrenia. He was controversial for his regular use of slurs, which he explained was his way of combating factors of psychological warfare. After 2017, he struggled with periods of homelessness and incarceration. In 2018, he was struck by a train and died at the age of 48.},
